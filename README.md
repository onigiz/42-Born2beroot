# 42-Born2beroot

- My personal notes on the Ecole 42born2beroot Project and some other resources.
- OtherNotes contains many pictures about the setting up.
- My notes are in handwritten style and both files are predominantly written in Turkish.


**Note:** I take the other resources notes from Davut Uzun who is cadet at 42 Istanbul 🤝:.
